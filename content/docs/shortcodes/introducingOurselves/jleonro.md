## WHOAMI

Hey there! My name's Jahel and I'm a software developer from Colombia. I'm a total anime fanatic and love to spend my free time binge-watching my favorite shows. But when I'm not glued to the screen, you can usually find me tinkering away on some new coding project.

In between my coding sessions and anime binges, I also enjoy indulging in some seriously trashy food. Give me a bag of chips or a pint of ice cream and I'm a happy camper.

Despite my love for all things anime and junk food, I'm also incredibly passionate about software development. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and techniques to add to my arsenal, and I never shy away from a challenging coding problem. Overall, I'm just a nerdy, anime-loving, trash food-eating software developer who is always up for a good time.
