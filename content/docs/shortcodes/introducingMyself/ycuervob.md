Hello! I am a computer systems engineering student passionate about constantly learning and applying new knowledge in areas such as cloud computing, back-end, and machine learning. I consider myself a proactive, organized, and responsible person, and I enjoy working in a team and learning from my peers.

I am always willing to learn and adapt to any challenge that arises, and I like to stay updated on the latest technological trends. If you are looking for someone with a great passion for technology and a solid focus on developing innovative computer solutions, I will be happy to work with you.

Besides my interest in technology, I also enjoy watching anime, movies, and TV shows. Some of my favorite movies include The Godfather, Forrest Gump, and La La Land. As for TV shows, I enjoy watching Breaking Bad and Black Mirror. I love exploring different genres of anime, from action and adventure to comedy and romance. Some of my favorite animes are Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, and Attack on Titan. I believe that my love for technology and entertainment allows me to be creative and think outside the box in my work and daily life.
